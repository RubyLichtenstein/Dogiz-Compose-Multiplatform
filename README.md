## Set up the environment

> **Warning**
> You need a Mac with macOS to write and run iOS-specific code on simulated or real devices.
> This is an Apple requirement.

To work with this template, you need the following:

* A machine running a recent version of macOS
* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* The [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
* The [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-cocoapods.html)

### Check your environment

Before you start, use the [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) tool to ensure that your development environment
is configured correctly:

1. Install KDoctor with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```text
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

2. Run KDoctor in your terminal:

    ```text
    kdoctor
    ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see valid output:

   ```text
   Environment diagnose (to see all details, use -v option):
   [‚úì] Operation System
   [‚úì] Java
   [‚úì] Android Studio
   [‚úì] Xcode
   [‚úì] Cocoapods
   
   Conclusion:
     ‚úì Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development!
   ```

Otherwise, KDoctor will highlight which parts of your setup still need to be configured and will suggest a way to fix
them.

## Examine the project structure

Open the project in Android Studio and switch the view from **Android** to **Project** to see all the files and targets
belonging to the project:

Your Compose Multiplatform project includes 4 modules:

### `shared`

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for desktop, Android, and iOS applications, that is, the code you
share between platforms.

This `shared` module is also where you'll write your Compose Multiplatform code.
In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.

It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`.
The `shared` module builds into a Java library, an Android library, and an iOS framework.

### `desktopApp`

This is a Kotlin module that builds into a desktop application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `desktopApp`
module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular library.

### `androidApp`

This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular Android library.

### `iosApp`

This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application.
It depends on and uses the `shared` module as a CocoaPods dependency.

## Run your application

### On desktop

To run your desktop application in Android Studio, select `desktopApp` in the list of run configurations and click **Run**:

<img src="readme_images/desktop_app_running.png" height="300px">

You can also run Gradle tasks in the terminal:

* `./gradlew run` to run application
* `./gradlew package` to store native distribution into `build/compose/binaries`

### On Android

To run your application on an Android emulator:

1. Ensure you have an Android virtual device available.
   Otherwise, [create one](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd).
2. In the list of run configurations, select `androidApp`.
3. Choose your virtual device and click **Run**:

    <img src="readme_images/android_app_running.png" height="300px">

<details>
  <summary>Alternatively, use Gradle</summary>

To install an Android application on a real Android device or an emulator, run `./gradlew installDebug` in the terminal.

</details>

### On iOS

#### Running on a simulator

To run your application on an iOS simulator in Android Studio, modify the `iosApp` run configuration:

1. In the list of run configurations, select **Edit Configurations**:

   <img src="readme_images/edit_run_config.png" height="200px">

2. Navigate to **iOS Application** | **iosApp**.
3. In the **Execution target** list, select your target device. Click **OK**:

   <img src="readme_images/target_device.png" height="400px">

4. The `iosApp` run configuration is now available. Click **Run** next to your virtual device:
